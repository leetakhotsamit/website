                <h4>Leeta Khotsamit</h4>
                <p>I am currently a third year student studying Biochemistry at the University of Waterloo. </p>
                <p>I enjoy learning about the chemical aspects that happen in biological processes which is part of the reason why I am in my program! I've recently became fascinated with the computer science world and have been taking some classes to become efficient in coding! I plan to pursue the bioinformatics option that is offered at the school.</p>
                <p> I also have a passion for learning new languages. The languages that I am currently trying to master is Spanish and I have continued to pursue in learning this language during my undergrad as well. My goal is to become proficient in the Spanish language. I am also considering in learning the French language as well and have taken a couple courses in highschool, but I wish to further study this language in my own time.</p>

Became familiar with various organic chemistry laboratory techniques on both the macro- and microscale, such as: separation of an unknown mixture using liquid-liquid extraction, analysis using melting point, using a delivery pipette, purification of a product by recrystallization, purification of products using acid-base chemistry, thin layer chromatography (TLC), microwave-assisted reactions, Infrared (IR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Focused on understanding concepts such as separation of acidic and neutral compound using liquid-liquid extraction, using acetaminophen as a precursor to an SN2 reaction, microwave-assisted elimination reactions: analyzing the effect of solvent on reaction mechanism, preparation of benzoic acid via a Grignard reagent, reduction of vanillin using a hydride reagent, and microwave-assisted Fischer esterification reactions.</p>

                          <p>Focused on learning the linux command line. Experienced how to run the BLAST command line and the prokka command line. Became familiar with tools such as FASTQC, Velvet, Abyss, Tablet, Artemis, Bandage, Muave, BWA, samtools and bcf tools. The course incorporated a project to which my team created a commandline that performed Genome Assembly, Annotation and Functional comparison tasks all at once. The pipeline that my team created was comparable to prokka, which is a tool to annotate bacterial, archaeal and viral genomes quickly and produces standards-compliant output files. </p>
                          <p>Project: Creating a comparative genomics pipeline that was similar to prokka. It takes Illumina raw sequence reads (either HiSeq or MiSeq platform), assembles genomes, predicts genes, annotates predicted genes, and performs basic comparisons. For quality control, the tools trimmomatic and FastQC were incorporated. The tool used for genome assembly was SPAdes. For gene prediction, we implemented tools such as Prodigal and FragGeneScan. We were then able to align the genes using the Diamond tool. Advantages with using our pipeline was the fact that it was able to compare more genes compares to those compared using prokka.</p>
